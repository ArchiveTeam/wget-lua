   To do so, it samples the speed in 150ms intervals and stores the
   recorded samples in a FIFO history ring.  The ring stores no more
   than 20 intervals, hence the history covers the period of at least
   three seconds and at most 20 reads into the past.  This method
   should produce reasonable results for downloads ranging from very
   slow to very fast.

   The idea is that for fast downloads, we get the speed over exactly
   the last three seconds.  For slow downloads (where a network read
   takes more than 150ms to complete), we get the speed over a larger
   time period, as large as it takes to complete thirty reads.  This
